                    A balcony is a platform that extends from the wall of a
                    building, typically above the ground floor, and is enclosed
                    by a railing or balustrade. Balconies are often used as an
                    outdoor space for relaxation, enjoying views, or growing
                    plants. They can be found in various architectural styles
                    and are common in residential buildings, hotels, and other
                    structures. Balconies can vary in size and design, ranging
                    from small Juliet balconies to larger ones that can
                    accommodate furniture and gatherings. They provide a
                    connection to the outdoors and can enhance the aesthetic
                    appeal of a building. Balconies are a popular feature in
                    modern architecture and can be designed to suit a variety of
                    styles.
